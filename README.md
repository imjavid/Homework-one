## Changes to the Head Element
Meta tag had an extra forwards lash in it. I removed that.
The title element was outside of the head element.
The title element was not self explanatory. I changed it to the "Horiseon Marking Agency”
Declaring language is a self closing element, so i removed the extra closing tag.

## Changes to "img" element
None of the "img” elements had alt attributes. I added attributes to all of them.
Some “img” elements had closing tags and some didn’t. I fixed them all with only self-closing tags.

## Page-jump URLS 
The page-jump urls for search engine Optimization and Social Marketing did not work before. I recreated their IDs and classes and are working now.

## Indenting
I also made some indenting changes to the code.

## Code clean-up
I cleaned up the code itself so it is easy to read.

## Semantic Elements Usage
Over all the orginaztion of the code was good and most elements were used semantically.

## CSS Code
The CSS code was used properlly with its proper properties.
